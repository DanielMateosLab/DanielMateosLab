## How I Met Software Development
When I was a child I loved to play computer games. To progress and reach an advanced level a lot of them had premium content or required a huge time investment, resources that I often lacked.

One day I discovered that there were little tricks AKA hacks and private servers. Although that was not very ethical, I could explore the limits of the games and feed my curiosity. Although useful, this "tricks" weren't perfect, being not as user-friendly as the original games, so a lot of times I ended reading forums trying to make the stuff work. This way I started to discover how thinks worked under the hood and I soon realized that knowing how to code was kind of a super power.

Back then, I was too young and eveything was too complicated: I never became a Vitalik Buterin. Nevertheless, I discovered that I loved computers and what you can do with them. Years later I decided to stop playing video games and to invest that time doing something that gave me more opportunities and freedom in the future, so my hobbie switched to learn software development. That journey continues today.
